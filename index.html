    <h1>Privacy Policy for SpyX the Game</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: March 03, 2025</p>
    
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how SpyX the Game (“the Company”, “We”, “Us”, or “Our”) collects, uses, and discloses information when You use the SpyX the Game mobile application (the “Service”). By using the Service, You agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Please note:</strong> At this time, SpyX the Game is free to use and does not require You to create an account.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>1.1 Usage Data</h3>
    <p>We automatically collect certain information about Your device and how You interact with the Service. This may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address</li>
      <li>Browser type and version</li>
      <li>The pages of the Service You visit and the time spent on them</li>
      <li>Unique device identifiers and diagnostic data</li>
      <li>Mobile device information such as device type, operating system, and mobile browser</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>1.2 Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>To enhance Your experience and support our Service, we use third-party services that may collect information on Your behalf:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ads:</strong> We use advertising services (e.g., Google Ads) to serve ads in our app.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> We use analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics) to help us understand how You use the Service and improve it.</li>
      <li><strong>Consent Management Platform (CMP):</strong> When targeting users in the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, we employ a Google-certified CMP. This CMP is integrated with the IAB’s Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF) and is used to collect and manage Your consent for personalized ads and other data processing activities in compliance with GDPR and other European regulations.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information collected for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain the Service:</strong> Ensuring that the app functions properly and is updated.</li>
      <li><strong>For Analytics:</strong> To analyze usage trends and improve the Service.</li>
      <li><strong>For Advertising:</strong> To display ads through our advertising partners, subject to the consent you provide via our CMP.</li>
      <li><strong>To Comply with Legal Obligations:</strong> Ensuring that we meet regulatory requirements, including those related to GDPR and other privacy laws.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since SpyX the Game does not require account creation, we do not store or manage any user account information.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Consent Management (For EEA, UK, and Switzerland Users)</h2>
    <p>When accessing the Service from the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, You will be presented with a consent dialog via our Google-certified Consent Management Platform (CMP). This platform:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Collects Your consent for processing Your data for personalized ads and analytics.</li>
      <li>Ensures compliance with GDPR and other relevant European regulations.</li>
      <li>Allows You to manage Your consent preferences at any time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Without Your consent through the CMP, only limited, non-personalized ads may be served.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain Usage Data for as long as necessary to provide and improve the Service, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. When data is no longer required, it will be securely deleted or anonymized.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Data Transfer</h2>
    <p>Your information may be processed and stored on servers located outside of Your country of residence. In such cases, we ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect Your data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable data protection laws.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect Your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Service is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under 13. If You believe that a child has provided Us with Personal Data, please contact Us so that we can take appropriate action.</p>
